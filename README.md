Machine Learning and Data Mining



I started my second trimester on my journey to a Masters in Data Science and one of the modules I am taking is Machine Learning and Data Mining. I will be updating my progress week by week. I will be making use of python and it's associated libraries in a jupyter notebook.
The first week was essentially an introduction to Python as a programming language, it's libraries, order of operations and a brief exploration of a dataset called iris.
The dataset was in a csv format. We used various functions and libraries to explore the dataset.
